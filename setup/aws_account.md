## AWS Account

For setting up the AWS account, please refer to this tutorial [AWS Account Setup](https://jhooq.com/terraform-ec2-instance-setup/#1-setup-aws-account).

For using AWS CLI, setting up EC2 instances via terraform, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY` are required. These keys can be generated by following the tutorial [Generate AWS Account Keys](https://jhooq.com/terraform-ec2-instance-setup/#2generate-access-keys-access-key-id-and-secret-access-key)
