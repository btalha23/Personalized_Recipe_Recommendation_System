## Model Monitoring


Connect Visual Studio Code on your local machine to the remote computer. Please refer to [this video by Alexey](https://youtu.be/IXSiYkP23zo?si=D1v6gBw-EZHnW5_V) from the timestamp 11.49 onwards to learn about how to connect your local Visual Studio Code to the remote computer.

Once connected, change directory to `monitoring`. The folder contains a Jupyter notebook entitled `prr_model_monitoring.ipynb`.

Open the notebook and run it as normal to generate Evidently AI reports.
